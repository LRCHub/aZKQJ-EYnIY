I'll call my woman and tell her that I'm working late again
That she shouldn't wait around on me
She should go on have fun with her friends
Then I'll take all the back streets like so many nights before
Pick up some wine and roses and knock on that cheating door

But this is the last time that I'll take the long way home
The last time I'll stop by so we can feed our lonely souls
I'll tell her that it's over and wipe the tears as she cries
It's the last time I'll hold her
Cause I'm down to my last lie

I know what I'm doing has to end it can't go on like this
But I lose the will to tell her with every little kiss
I keep telling myself I can do it but I can't when I look in her eyes
Cause she's got a way of making me put it off until next time

So this is the last time that I'll take the long way home
The last time I'll stop by so we can feed our lonely souls
I'll tell her that it's over and wipe the tears as she cries
It's the last time I'll hold her
Cause I'm down to my last lie

I don't wanna live without her
But I just can't live with myself

So this is the last time that I'll take take the long way home
The last time I'll stop by so we can feed our lonely souls
I'll tell her that it's over and wipe the tears as she cries
It's the last time I'll hold her
Cause I'm down to my last lie

It's the last time I'll hold her
Cause I'm down to my last lie
